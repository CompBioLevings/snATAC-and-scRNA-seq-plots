# snATAC-and-scRNA-seq-plots
This repository consists of two **Jupyter Notebooks** created to document a comparison of a mouse brain snATAC-seq (single nuclei assay for transposase accessible chromatin with sequencing) data set from [CATlas](http://catlas.org/mousebrain/) with a scRNA-seq (single cell RNA sequencing) data set from the Linnarsson lab's [Mouse brain atlas](http://mousebrain.org/).  Specifically, in this code, I identify differences in neuronal vs other cell types in the mouse brain based on chromatin accessibility (snATAC-seq signal of a specific region aggregated by cell type/cluster) and gene expression (scRNA-seq signal aggregated by cell type/cluster).
